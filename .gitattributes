# File: .gitattributes
# Policy:
# - Git stores normalized LF in the repo/index for text.
# - Windows/Visual Studio edited files use CRLF in the working tree.
# - Cross-platform text stays LF in the working tree.

# Default: treat files as text automatically; checkout as LF unless overridden below.
* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Visual Studio / Windows-centric text: CRLF in working tree ---

# If XML is edited in Visual Studio often, CRLF prevents VS from "fixing" it.

# --- Repo meta files: keep LF (avoids “mixed” warnings in these files themselves) ---
