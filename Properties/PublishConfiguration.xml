  <LongDescription>
	  Is your city stuck behind slow bikes? 🚴🚴🚗🚐🚚🚙

	  🚲 Fast Bikes and electric scooters.

	  🛣️ NEW: PATH speed limit - YES - now you can change bike paths (separate from roads)!

	  - No known road mod lets you set "path" speeds.

	  #### Features

	  ✅  Speed ⬆️ ⬇️
	  ✅  Smoothing math for acceleration + braking
	  ✅  Optional sway stability tuning
	  ✅  One-click Reset buttons.

	  #### Tech notes

	  - Road speed limits and game conditions may still cap speeds.
	  - Compatible with "Road Speed Adjuster" mod.
	  - Path speed is **new**, please report any issues with this part.
	  - To disable the mod without uninstalling, uncheck [ ] the box.
	  - Safe to remove any time (reset button first for cleanest return to game defaults).
	  - Has 11 Languages

	  #### Support and Feedback

	  If the mod helps you, give it a Like :), it's free.
	  Report issues on Github link, Forum, or Discord.

	  #### Performant design

	  - Great effort made to ensure this runs only when you change mod menu settings, then goes idle.
	  - Does not run continuously per-frame in cities to impact fps :)
