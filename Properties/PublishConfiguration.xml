	<LongDescription>
🚲 Fast Bikes speeds up bicycles and scooters.

🚴 NEW: PATH speed limit - YES - now you can change bike paths (paths are independent of road speed limits)!

- No known road mod lets you set "path" speeds so this is unique to this mod.

#### Features

✅  Speed ⬆️ ⬇️
✅  Smoothing math for acceleration + braking (no teleport and panic braking)
✅  Optional stability tuning (affects swaying)
✅  One-click Reset buttons.

#### Tech notes

- Road speed limits and game conditions may still cap speeds.
- Compatible with "Road Speed Adjuster" mod (as that does normal roads and not paths).
- Path speed is **new** beta feature, please report issues.
- To disable the mod without uninstalling, uncheck [ ] the enable box.
- Safe to remove (Reset button first for fast return to game defaults, then save city, and uninstall).
- Has 11 Languages

#### Support and Feedback

- If the mod helps, drop a Like :)
- Report issues on Github / Forum / Discord.

#### Performant design

- This runs only when you change mod menu settings.
- Does not run continuously per-frame in cities to impact fps :)
