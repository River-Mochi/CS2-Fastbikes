Is your city stuck behind slow bikes? 🚴🚴🚗🚐🚚🚙

🚲 Fast Bikes speeds up bicycles and scooters.
It applies a scalar and adjusts acceleration/braking so that high speeds don't look like "teleport + panic braking."

🛣️ NEW: PATH speed limit - YES - now you can change bike paths (not the same as road speed limits)!

- No known road mod lets you set "path" speeds so this is unique to this mod.

#### Features

✅  Speed ⬆️ ⬇️
✅  Smoothing math for acceleration + braking
✅  Optional stability tuning (affects swaying)
✅  One-click Reset buttons.

#### Tech notes

- Road speed limits and game conditions may still cap speeds.
- Compatible with "Road Speed Adjuster" mod (it does normal roads and not paths).
- Path speed is **new**, please report issues.
- To disable the mod without uninstalling, uncheck [ ] the box.
- Safe to remove (Reset button first for cleanest return to game defaults).
- Has 11 Languages

#### Support and Feedback

If the mod helps, drop a Like :)
Report issues on Github / Forum / Discord.

#### Performant design

- Effort made to ensure this runs only when you change mod menu settings.
- Does not run continuously per-frame in cities to impact fps :)
