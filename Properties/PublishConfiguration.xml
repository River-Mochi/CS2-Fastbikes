  <LongDescription>Is your city stuck behind slow bikes?

Fast Bikes speeds up bicycles and electric scooters (or slows them down).

### Features

- Speed multiplier
- Uses a smoothing formula for acceleration + braking
- Optional sway stability tuning (stiffness/damping)
- One-click Reset buttons.

### Tech notes

- Road speed limits and game conditions may still cap speeds.
- To make Fast-bikes even better, install "Road Speed Adjuster" mod to change road speeds.
- Uncheck Enable to disable the mod without uninstalling.
- Safe to remove any time (reset first for the cleanest return to game defaults).

### Support and Feedback

If the mod helps you, give it a Like :)
Report issues on Github link, Forum, or Discord.

### Performant design

- Great effort was made to ensure this runs only when you change mod menu settings, then goes idle.
- Does not run per-frame continuously in-city to impact fps :)
