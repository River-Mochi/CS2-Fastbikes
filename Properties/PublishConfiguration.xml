🚲 Fast Bikes: speeds up bicycles and scooters.

🚴 NEW: Path speed limit - YES - now you can change bike paths (paths are independent of road speed limits)!
🚴 NEW: Status report - compare Bike versus Cars usage (this can be used without enabling Fast Bikes checkbox).

- road mods don't let you set "path" speeds so this is unique to this mod.

#### Features

- ✅  Speed ⬆️ ⬇️
- ✅  Smoothing math for acceleration + braking (no teleport and panic braking)
- ✅  Optional stability tuning (affects swaying)
- ✅  One-click Reset buttons.

#### Tech notes

- Road speed limits and game conditions may still cap speeds.
- Compatible with "Road Speed Adjuster" mod (as that does normal roads and not paths).
- Path speed is **new** beta feature, please report issues.
- To disable the mod without uninstalling, uncheck [ ] the enable box.
- Safe to remove (Reset button first for fast return to game defaults, then save city, and uninstall).
- Has 11 Languages

#### Support and Feedback

- If the mod helps, drop a Like :)
- Report issues on Github / Forum / Discord.

#### Design

- This runs only when you change mod menu settings.
- Does not run continuously per-frame in cities to impact fps :)
